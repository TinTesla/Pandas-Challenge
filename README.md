Module 4

Data Summary:

Across the various metrics, many data points were provided. Metrics seem to tell a consistent story with little/ no outliers. One of the only metrics I would be curious to investigate further is the success rates of students based on specified genders. Investing further could potentially provide insight into favoritism based on gender identity.

Conclusions:

#1 - As indicated in the header, the highest overall passing rates were from students attending Small/ Medium Charter schools with limited per-student budgets. Across all schools, passing rates for reading scores were higher than the passing rates for math scores. Further research on how these schools are structuring their curriculum could prove useful in investigating the different rates of success. Dividing the data into smaller bin sizes may also be advised for better categorization. 

#2 - Overall passing scores seem consistent across class grades per school. This implies that student success per school is constant, with budgeting / attaching being divided equally across all students of all levels. Concerning conclusion #1, we may be able to infer that these smaller charter schools are better able to monitor/attend to the individual needs of their students. 

Side Notes:

I ended up having a few of the provided codes give some error codes, so I had to do some bugfixing. I compared my results to those provided in the original copy, and all results matched at the end. My apologies if my bugfixing compounded any of my operational mistakes.
